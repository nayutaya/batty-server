= ActiveForm

This plugin provides a base class for making forms with ActiveRecord validations without having a corresponding database table.  You can use ActiveForm for:

* making forms which don't needed storage, like simple email forms
* provide extra validations on existing ActiveRecord models
* make forms for composite objects
